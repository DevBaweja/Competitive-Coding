avg of first k multiple of n
n*(1+2+..k)/k = n*(k(k+1)/2)/k = n*(k+1)/2

avg of k numbers is avg
each number is 
multiply by c : new avg = c*avg 
divide by c : new avg = avg/c
add by c : new avg = avg + k*c/k = avg + c
subtract by c : avg - k*c/k = avg - c

consecutive number 
3 number are x-c, x, x+c
5 number are x-2c, x-c, x, x+c, x+2c

consecutive even x-2, x, x+2

avg of k is increases by  m unit, replace a to a'
k*m
a' = a+k*m
